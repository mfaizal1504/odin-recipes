        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 1/4 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded coconut</li>
        <li>5 whole cloves</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the coconut in a dry wok, stirring continuously until golden brown. Set aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using a blender or a food processor, blend the shallots, garlics, chillies, ginger, and lemon grass to a thick paste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grind the corriander, fennel, cumin and nutmeg.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using the wok, fry the shallot paste in a little oil for a few minutes. Add the ground corriander, fennel, cumin and
            nutmeg; cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring continuously. Add beef; cook over a medium heat for a further 3 to 4 minutes,
            or until meat is browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in sugar, coconut, cloves, cinnamon stick, coconut milk, and water. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer until
            most of the liquid has gone and the meat is tender (about an hour). Season with salt to taste.
