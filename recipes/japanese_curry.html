    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Japanese curry is different from Indian or Thai curries. It is more of a brown stew and it can be mild or spicy, depending on your tastes.
        It can be served over white rice or with udon noodles. This recipe is very flexible; it can be easily made for more or less people.

            Heat oil in 6-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and saute until brown, 5 to 7 minutes.
            Add onions and cook until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add ketchup and Worcestershire sauce.
            Stir to coat. Add cayenne pepper. Pour in water to cover mixture by 1 or 2 inches. Add carrots and bouillon.
        </li>
        <li>
            Simmer, skimming fat off the surface of the broth as needed, for 30 minutes. Add potatoes.
            Stir in 1 package of curry roux and let dissolve; add remaining curry roux as needed to achieve
            desired thickness. Continue simmering until beef and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.
